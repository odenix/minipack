# Introduction

MxPack is a modern Java library for reading and writing the [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) serialization format.

The Kotlin examples on this website use MxPack's [Kotlin integration](kotlin-integration.md).

## Example

The following code writes a string and number to `path`, then reads them back:

/// tab | Java
```{.java}
-8<- "HelloMxPack.java:snippet"
```

1. Creates a `:::java MessageWriter` that writes to `:::java out`.
   The `:::java try` block ensures that the writer is always closed and not used thereafter.
2. Encodes string `:::java "Hello, MxPack!"` and writes it to `:::java out`.
3. Encodes number `:::java 42` and writes it to `:::java out`.
4. Creates a `:::java MessageReader` that reads from `:::java in`.
   The `:::java try` block ensures that the reader is always closed and not used thereafter.
5. Reads a string from `:::java in` and decodes it to `:::java "Hello, MxPack!"`.
6. Reads a number from `:::java in` and decodes it to `:::java 42`.
///

/// tab | Kotlin
```{.kotlin}
-8<- "HelloMxPack.kt:snippet"
```

1. Creates a `:::kotlin MessageWriter` that writes to `:::kotlin out`.
   The `:::kotlin use {}` block ensures that the writer is always closed and not used thereafter.
2. Encodes string `:::kotlin "Hello, MxPack!"` and writes it to `:::kotlin out`.
3. Encodes number `:::kotlin 42` and writes it to `:::kotlin out`.
4. Creates a `:::kotlin MessageReader` that reads from `:::kotlin in`.
   The `:::kotlin use {}` block ensures that the reader is always closed and not used thereafter.
5. Reads a string from `:::kotlin in` and decodes it to `:::kotlin "Hello, MxPack!"`.
6. Reads a number from `:::kotlin in` and decodes it to `:::kotlin 42`.
